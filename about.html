    <h3>Types of Autism</h3>
    <p class="about-text">The "autism spectrum" describes a set of developmental delays and disorders that affect social and communication skills and, to a greater or lesser degree, motor and language skills.

      It is such a broad diagnosis that it can include people with high IQs and mental retardation. People with autism can be chatty or silent, affectionate or cold, methodical or disorganized.

      Until May 2013, official diagnoses within the autism spectrum included autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder—not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Rett syndrome.

      Today, there is just one autism spectrum disorder, with three levels of severity—but many therapists, clinicians, parents, and organizations continue to use terms like PDD-NOS and Asperger syndrome. </p>


    <h3 class="types">Autistic Disorder</h3>
    <p class="about-text">This is sometimes called “classic” autism. It is what most people think of when hearing the word “autism”. People with autistic disorder usually have significant language delays, social and communication challenges, and
      unusual behaviors and interests. Many people with autistic disorder also have intellectual disability.</p>

    <h3 class="types">Asperger Syndrome</h3>
    <p class="about-text">People with Asperger syndrome usually have milder symptoms of autistic disorder. They might have social challenges and unusual behaviors and interests. However, they typically do not have problems with language or
      intellectual disability.</p>

    <h3 class="types">Pervasive Developmental Disorder<br>– Not Otherwise Specified</h3>
    <p class="about-text">This is sometimes called “atypical autism,” or PDD-NOS. People who meet some of the criteria for autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome, but not all, may be diagnosed with atypical autism. These people usually have fewer and
      milder symptoms than those with autistic disorder. The symptoms might cause only social and communication challenges.</p>

    <h3 class="symptoms-title">Signs of Autism in Childhood</h3>

    <h3 class="types1">Signs in Young Children</h3>
    <p class="about-text">The earliest signs of autism involve the absence of typical behaviors—not the presence of atypical ones—so they can be tough to spot. In some cases, the earliest symptoms of autism are even misinterpreted as signs of a “good
      baby,” since the infant may seem quiet, independent, and undemanding. However, you can catch warning signs early if you know what to look for.Some autistic infants don’t respond to cuddling, reach out to be picked up, or look at their mothers
      when being fed.</p>

    <ul class="symptoms3">
      <li>Child not responding to their name</li>
      <li>If the avoiding eye contact consistently</li>
      <li>If the child is not smiling when you smile at him/her</li>
      <li>Signs of sensory overload getting very upset if they do not like a certain taste, smell or loud sound.</li>
      <li>Repetitive movements, such as flapping their hands, flicking their fingers or rocking their body</li>
      <li>not talking as much as other children.</li>
      <li>Repeating the same phrases</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="types1">Signs in Older Children</h3>
    <p class="about-text">As children get older, the red flags for autism become more diverse. There are many warning signs and symptoms, but they typically revolve around impaired social skills, speech and language difficulties, non-verbal
      communication difficulties, and inflexible behavior
    </p>

    <ul class="symptoms3">
      <li>not seeming to understand what others are thinking or feeling</li>
      <li>finding it hard to say how they feel</li>
      <li>liking a strict daily routine and getting very upset if it changes</li>
      <li>having a very keen interest in certain subjects or activities</li>
      <li>getting very upset if you ask them to do something</li>
      <li>finding it hard to make friends or preferring to be on their own</li>
      <li>taking things very literally – for example, they may not understand phrases like "break a leg"</li>

    </ul>
